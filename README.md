# Maze Solving Algorithm

This coursework project involves implementing a maze-solving algorithm written in Java. The algorithm reads input from a `.txt` file representing a maze, which includes start and finish points, ice, and walls. The goal is to navigate through the maze to reach the end while displaying the moves made in the console.

## Features

- **Maze Input:** Reads maze configuration from a `.txt` file.
- **Maze Elements:** Supports start, finish, ice, and walls.
- **Console Output:** Displays the maze and the moves made to solve it.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** For implementing the algorithm.
- **VSCode:** Development environment.
